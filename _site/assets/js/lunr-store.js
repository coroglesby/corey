        "text": "              \"Nothing\"         In the Fall of 2018 at the University of Idaho, the composer Samson Matthews interpreted my poem \"Nothing\" (forthcoming in Puerto del Sol) for an original choral arrangement. This is a recording of its only performance.                               \"Fragile Hearts\"         Choreographer Belle Baggs interpreted my poem \"Compliment\" for her students' Spring 2018 performance. The video below is an excerpt of the longer sequence, titled \"Fragile Hearts,\" performed by University of Idaho Dance Program students Katrina Alverez, Taylor Eddleston, Kyley Knudson, Gin Robinson, and Abigail Shepard. A recording of me reading the poem is played along with the choreography at 1:35, and you can read the poem over at Blood Orange Review (where it was originally published in the Spring of 2018).                               \"Walking Home in the Swelling Shadow of the Bomb,\" read by Derek Annis         My friend and fellow poet Derek Annis read my poem \"Walking Home in the Swelling Shadow of the Bomb\" (which you can also read here)for Spokane Public Radio's awesome Poetry Moment series. Maybe this isn't *exactly* a collaboration, but I'm so honored that Derek chose to read this poem, and I think they actually read it better than I do. Please do yourself a favor and check out Derek's work via the button below.                        Listen to the poem                   Visit Derek's site          "

We self-recorded/produced a single full-length (see links below) and played a handful of shows in and around the Western Maryland area. The unimaginably talented Tanika Henry recorded the saxophone parts on \"Some People\" (track 2) and \"Clean\" (track 7) in one, improvised take. The crowd vocals at the end of \"Not Home\" (track 10) were performed by pretty much everyone I knew and loved in Frostburg, Maryland, in my living room around a single mic.              Download the Album            Agent and The Patient—2006-09                                            Agent and The Patient was a post-hardcore band that consisted of Matt Combs (drums), Andrew Combs (bass), and me (guitar, vocals), from about 2006 to 2009 (though we'd been playing as a 3-piece for years under different names/projects). We released only one official recording, which you can download below for free—it was recorded by Kenny McClure in La Plata, MD, over the course of about 3 years (for whatever reason). We also recorded the music for a full-length with Kenny in 2008, but the band (amicably) called it quits before vocals could be recorded.              Download the EP            Flashbasket—2000-2006                                            Flashbasket was my first band. A pretty terrible band name, admittedly, but better than our original name, Ground Zero (which we decided to change after 9/11). Flashbasket consisted of Matt Combs (drums), Andrew Combs (bass, vocals), and me (guitar, vocals). We self-produced/released a few full-length punk albums before our final 2005 EP, Box-Cutter Songs (download below), which was recorded by Dan Longfellow in Waldorf, MD. This band was my youth, and where I first learned how to make art.
