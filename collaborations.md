In the Fall of 2018 at the University of Idaho, the composer Samson Matthews interpreted my poem "Nothing" (forthcoming in *Puerto del Sol*) for an original choral arrangement, and this is a recording of its only performance.

Choreographer Belle Baggs interpreted my poem "Compliment" for her students' Spring 2018 performance. The video below is an excerpt of the longer sequence, titled "Fragile Hearts," performed by University of Idaho Dance Program students Katrina Alverez, Taylor Eddleston, Kyley Knudson, Gin Robinson, and Abigail Shepard. A recording of me reading the poem is played along with the choreography at 1:35, and you can [read the poem over at Blood Orange Review](http://bloodorangereview.com/coreyoglesby/compliment/) (where it was originally published in the Spring of 2018).
